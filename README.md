## Description
<br>
Project Requirements
<br>
Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
<br>
Use React for the front end.
<br>
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
<br>
Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
<br>
Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
<br>
Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
<br>

Be responsive.
<br>
Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
<br>
Include authentication (JWT).
<br>
Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
<br>
Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
<br>
Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
<br>
CSS Styling
CSS library like Bootstrap
<br>
Tailwind.css
<br>
Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.
<br>
Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose—it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.
Payment Platform
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.
